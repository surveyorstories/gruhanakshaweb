# ✂️ Polygon Splitter

`Available from v3.0.0`

:::info
This tool is built upon the **[Split Features On Steroids](https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/SplitPolygonShowingAreas/)** plugin, featuring enhancements and adaptations tailored to Resurvey requirements.
:::

The **Polygon Splitter** provides a dedicated interactive environment for precisely dividing polygon features. It opens a custom window with a map canvas where you can draw split lines, edit vertices, automatically adjust areas to target values, and add measurement markers.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Launching the Tool

1. Load a polygon layer in QGIS.
2. Select the polygon layer in the Layers panel.
3. Click the **Polygon Splitter** icon from the Gruhanaksha plugin menu.
4. A new window titled "Gruhanaksha Polygon Splitter" will open.

### Interface Overview

The Polygon Splitter window contains:

- **Map Canvas**: Displays your selected layers and features. This mirrors the main QGIS canvas.
- **Toolbar**: Contains all editing and measurement tools (detailed below).
- **Unit Selector**: Dropdown menu to choose measurement units for areas and lengths.
  - **Area Units**: Acres, Hectares, Sq Meters, Sq Feet, Sq Yards, **Guntas**
  - Linear units are automatically paired with area units (e.g., feet with acres)
- **Layer Selection Button**: Choose which layers to display in the splitter canvas.

### Changing Measurement Units

The **Unit Selector** dropdown is located in the toolbar and allows you to change how areas and lengths are displayed.

**How to Use**:

1. Click the **Unit Selector** dropdown in the toolbar.
2. Choose your preferred unit from the list:
   - **Acres** (with feet for linear measurements)
   - **Hectares** (with meters for linear measurements)

## 💡 Best Practices

### Snapping Configuration

- Configure snapping settings in QGIS before starting (Settings → Snapping Options).
- Set an appropriate snapping tolerance (e.g., 10 pixels).
- Enable snapping to vertices and segments for precision.
- Use the Snap Toggle in the toolbar to quickly enable/disable snapping.

### Layer Management

- Use the "Select Layers" button to show only relevant layers in the splitter window.
- Lock layers you don't want to edit accidentally.
- Temporarily hide layers to reduce visual clutter.

### Working with Complex Splits

- For complex geometries, work incrementally - split in stages rather than all at once.
- Use the "Add Marker" tool to verify measurements before finalizing splits.
- Use "Adjust Area" for precise land parcel divisions where exact areas are required.
- Save frequently to prevent data loss.

### Undo/Redo

- Use Ctrl+Z to undo mistakes immediately.
- The undo/redo functionality works for both drawing operations and completed splits.
- Undo history is maintained even after performing a split.
